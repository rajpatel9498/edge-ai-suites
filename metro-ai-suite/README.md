The Metro AI Suite helps accelerate application development for sophisticated edge AI video safety, security, and smart city use cases. 

The Metro AI Suite enables you to utilize Intel software such as OpenVINO&trade; toolkit, Intel&reg; Deep Learning Streamer, Intel&reg; oneAPI, and other tools, libraries, and microservices for media analytics and AI performance optimization for abovementioned use cases.  

For device and equipment manufacturers, the suite also provides a [device qualification tool](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=metro-ai-suite-device-qualification-for-hardware-builder) to verify and benchmark hardware performance and create system qualification reports. See [recommended hardware catalog](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/edge-solutions/hardware.html) for a list of qualified system configurations.

Some of the sample applications offered within Metro AI Suite are:

- [Loitering Detection](loitering-detection): Effortlessly monitor and manage areas with AI-driven video analytics for real-time insights and enhanced security
- [Image-Based Video Search](image-based-video-search): Performs near real-time analysis and image-based search to detect and retrieve objects of interest in large video datasets.
- [Smart Parking](smart-parking): Effortlessly manage parking spaces with AI-driven video analytics for real-time insights and enhanced efficiency.

See respective sample applications to learn more about using them in your application development as well as customizing them to meet your use case needs.
